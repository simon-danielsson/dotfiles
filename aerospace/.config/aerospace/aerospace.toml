# === simple-bar setup ===

# https://www.jeantinland.com/toolbox/simple-bar-server/documentation/installation/

# In order to run this project, you will need to install globally the following dependencies:
#
#     node >=18.11.0
#     npm
#     pm2 >=5.3.0
#
# You can now clone this project anywhere on your computer:
#
# git clone https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar-server.git
#
# Then, go to the project folder and run the following commands:
#
# # Install local dependencies
# npm install
#
# # Run the server
# npm run start
#
# # Register the server to be run at startup
# # pm2 will ask you to run a command as sudo to register it ("sudo env PATH=...")
# pm2 startup
#
# # Save the current pm2 configuration
# pm2 save
#
#     On the first run, node will ask for Übersicht control permissions. You need to allow it to be able to refresh simple-bar automatically on simple-bar-server restart.
#
# Something is wrong in this documentation? Please open an issue on ShitHub in simple-bar-server repo.
