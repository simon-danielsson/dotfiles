# The ultimate swedish development environment

This **TMUX/Neovim config** was set up for **Rust** development, although I also play around with **Python** and **GDScript** once in a while. My goal with this config was to create a **minimal** and **maintainable** development environment - to achieve this, I put focus on utilizing the native features of Neovim first and foremost, only using the plugins I felt I could absolutely not live without.
> Note that this is **not** intended to be installed as a complete config - instead, I recommend that you sift through these files and take inspiration. Feel free to copy/paste into your own config as you see fit!
